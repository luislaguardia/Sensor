Assumptions:

The robot has functions to control its movements: move_forward(), turn_left(), turn_right(), and stop_or_search().
The sensor readings (sensors) are updated every cycle.

Explanation of the Code
Binary Conversion:

The read_sensors() function simulates reading 8 sensor values. You would replace this with actual sensor inputs from your hardware.
The sensor list is converted to a binary number to interpret the position easily.
Movement Decisions:

The control_robot() function uses the binary pattern to decide the movement:
0b00011000: Robot is centered, so it moves forward.
0b11100000, 0b11000000, 0b10000000: Line is far to the left, so the robot turns right.
0b00000011, 0b00000111, 0b00000001: Line is far to the right, so it turns left.
0b00000000: No line detected; the robot stops or searches.
Minor offsets (like 0b00010000 or 0b00001000) indicate small deviations, so slight turns are made to keep the robot on track.
Testing in a Loop:

The while True loop lets the robot continuously check and adjust its position. Add a small delay if needed for smoother operation.
Notes for Testing and Fine-Tuning
Hardware Testing: When you implement this on actual hardware, test and adjust the binary patterns and control logic based on how your robotâ€™s sensors detect the line.
Calibration: Calibrate sensor sensitivity so that it correctly differentiates between the line and background surfaces.
Movement Speed: Adjust motor speeds to achieve smooth turns based on how far the line is from the center.
